This is a simple BPMS process converted from a BPEL Project

For demo only, not for production use.

Script Tasks using random number generators are used to exercise different paths of the business process.

The Signal part is used to simulate an external call followed (after a random amount of time) to receive an external event (JMS) sent by the Signal.
